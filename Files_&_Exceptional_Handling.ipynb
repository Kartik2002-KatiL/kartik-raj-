        "\n",
        "* **Scenario:**  Preferable when dealing with I/O-bound tasks, like network requests, file operations, or user interaction.\n",

        " * **CPU-Bound Tasks:**  For computationally intensive tasks, multiprocessing enables true parallel execution by utilizing multiple CPU cores. This allows programs to complete tasks much faster than with single-threaded or multithreaded execution (which is limited by the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in CPython).\n",
        " * **Increased Performance:** Distributing tasks across multiple processes effectively improves performance for CPU-bound applications, leading to significant speed gains, especially on systems with multiple cores.\n",
        " * **Improved Responsiveness:**  In some cases, multiprocessing can enhance the responsiveness of a program, especially when dealing with tasks that can block or take a significant amount of time.\n",

        "# In concurrent programs (those using multithreading or multiprocessing), exception handling becomes even more critical than in single-threaded programs. Here's why:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# 1. Cascading Failures:  When one thread or process encounters an exception, it can potentially impact other threads or processes, especially if they share resources or depend on each other. An unhandled exception in one part of a concurrent program could lead to a cascade of failures, bringing down the entire system.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 2. Data Corruption:  If exceptions are not handled gracefully, shared data structures or resources can become corrupted, leading to unpredictable behavior and difficult-to-debug errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 3. Resource Leaks:  Threads or processes might hold onto resources (like file handles, network connections, or locks) even after encountering an exception. If not released properly, this can lead to resource leaks, affecting the overall performance and stability of the application.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 4. Difficult Debugging:  Debugging concurrent programs is inherently more challenging than debugging sequential programs. Unhandled exceptions can make it even more complex to pinpoint the source of errors and understand the flow of execution.\n",

        "# 1. Try-Except Blocks:\n",
        "#   * The most fundamental way to handle exceptions is to wrap potentially problematic code within a `try-except` block. This allows you to catch specific exceptions and take appropriate actions, such as logging the error, retrying the operation, or gracefully shutting down the thread or process.\n",

        "# 2. Thread-Specific Exception Handlers:\n",
        "#   * In multithreading environments, you might want to implement custom exception handling logic for each thread. This can be achieved by creating a custom thread class and overriding its `run()` method to include a `try-except` block that catches specific exceptions within that thread's context.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 3. Exception Propagation:\n",
        "#   * Exceptions can be propagated up the call stack to higher levels of the program. You can utilize this mechanism to handle exceptions at a centralized point, ensuring that all exceptions are caught and addressed properly.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 4. Queue-Based Communication:\n",
        "#   * If exceptions need to be handled by a different thread or process, you can use a queue to communicate the exceptions. A thread encountering an exception can put the exception information into a queue, and another designated thread can monitor the queue and handle those exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 5. Using Signals (for Processes):\n",
        "#   * In multiprocessing, you can use signals (e.g., SIGTERM, SIGINT) to communicate errors or exceptions between processes. A process encountering an exception can send a signal to another process responsible for handling errors.\n",
