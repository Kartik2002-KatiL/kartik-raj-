        "Ans. NumPy (short for Numerical Python) is a powerful library in Python that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently. NumPy is fundamental in scientific computing and data analysis due to its speed, flexibility, and ability to handle large data sets, making it an essential building block for more advanced libraries like Pandas, SciPy, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow.\n",

        "1. Efficient Memory Use and Performance:- Python lists are flexible but consume more memory because they store objects, which can be of varying types. In contrast, NumPy arrays are more memory-efficient because they store elements of the same type in contiguous blocks of memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "Vectorized operations in NumPy eliminate the need for slow Python loops by utilizing fast, compiled C/C++ implementations. This results in significant performance boosts, especially when working with large datasets.\n",

        "Vectorization in NumPy refers to the process of applying operations to entire arrays (or collections of data) without the need for explicit loops in Python. These operations are performed element-wise on the arrays using optimized C and Fortran implementations, making them faster than looping through elements one by one.\n",
