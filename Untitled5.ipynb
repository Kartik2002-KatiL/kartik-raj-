        "\n",
        "3. **Rich Standard Library**: Python comes with a comprehensive standard library that includes modules and functions for tasks such as file handling, web development, data manipulation, and more, reducing the need for third-party libraries.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Strong Community Support**: A vibrant and active community contributes to a wealth of resources, tutorials, and third-party packages, ensuring that help is readily available and that the language continues to evolve.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Python runs on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, allowing developers to write code that can be executed in different environments with minimal adjustments.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Extensive Libraries and Frameworks**: Python has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks (like NumPy, Pandas, Django, and Flask) that facilitate rapid development in fields like web development, data science, machine learning, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Interactivity and Prototyping**: Python’s interactive shell allows for quick experimentation and prototyping, which is especially useful in data analysis and scientific computing.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Integration Capabilities**: Python easily integrates with other languages and technologies, allowing developers to leverage existing codebases and tools effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Strong Data Handling and Scientific Computing**: With libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and Pandas, Python is well-equipped for data analysis and scientific computing, making it a preferred choice in academia and industry alike.\n",
        "\n",

        "###Ans.Predefined keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meaning and serve specific functions in the language. These keywords cannot be used as identifiers (like variable names) because they are integral to Python’s syntax and control structures.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Roles of Predefined Keywords:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Control Flow**: Keywords like `if`, `elif`, `else`, `for`, `while`, and `break` help control the flow of execution in a program.\n",
        "  \n",
        "2. **Data Definition**: Keywords such as `def`, `class`, and `import` are used to define functions, classes, and import modules, respectively.\n",

        "3. **Variable Management**: Keywords like `global` and `nonlocal` are used to declare variable scopes.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Exception Handling**: Keywords like `try`, `except`, `finally`, and `raise` are used for handling exceptions and errors gracefully.\n",

        "### Examples of Usage:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Control Flow Example**:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   age = 18\n",
        "   if age >= 18:\n",
        "       print(\"You are an adult.\")\n",
        "   else:\n",
        "       print(\"You are a minor.\")\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   Here, `if`, `else`, and `print` are keywords. The `if` keyword checks a condition, and the `else` keyword provides an alternative action.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Function Definition Example**:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   def greet(name):\n",
        "       print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "   greet(\"Alice\")\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   In this example, `def` is used to define a function named `greet`, which takes a parameter `name`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Loop Example**:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   for i in range(5):\n",
        "       print(i)\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   The `for` keyword creates a loop that iterates over a range of numbers from 0 to 4.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Exception Handling Example**:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   try:\n",
        "       x = 10 / 0\n",
        "   except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
        "       print(\"You can't divide by zero!\")\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",

        "# 6.How do conditional statement work in Python . Illustrate with example.\n",
        "###Ans.Conditional statements in Python allow you to execute certain pieces of code based on whether a condition evaluates to `True` or `False`. The primary conditional statements are `if`, `elif`, and `else`. Here’s a breakdown of how they work, along with examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Basic Structure\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **if Statement**: Evaluates a condition. If it’s `True`, the block of code within the `if` statement runs.\n",
        "2. **elif Statement**: Stands for \"else if.\" You can check multiple conditions sequentially.\n",
        "3. **else Statement**: Runs if none of the preceding conditions are `True`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Syntax\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "if condition1:\n",
        "    # Code to execute if condition1 is True\n",
        "elif condition2:\n",
        "    # Code to execute if condition2 is True\n",
        "else:\n",
        "    # Code to execute if neither condition is True\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example\n",
        "\n",
        "Let’s say we want to determine if a person is eligible to vote based on their age.\n",

        "    print(\"You are not eligible to vote yet.\")\n",
        "```\n",

        "### Explanation\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **if age >= 18**:\n",
        "   - Checks if `age` is greater than or equal to 18. If this condition is `True`, it prints \"You are eligible to vote.\"\n",
        "  \n",
        "2. **elif age < 0**:\n",
        "   - This checks if `age` is negative. If this condition is `True`, it prints \"Age cannot be negative.\" This acts as an additional check to ensure valid age input.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **else**:\n",
        "   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it executes this block, printing \"You are not eligible to vote yet.\"\n",

        "### Another Example with Multiple Conditions\n",
        "\n",
        "You can also use logical operators to combine multiple conditions. Here’s an example of grading based on scores:\n",

        "### Explanation\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **if score >= 90**:\n",
        "   - If the score is 90 or above, it prints \"Grade: A.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **elif score >= 80**:\n",
        "   - If the score is between 80 and 89, it prints \"Grade: B.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Additional `elif` statements** check for grades down to \"F\" for scores below 60.\n",
