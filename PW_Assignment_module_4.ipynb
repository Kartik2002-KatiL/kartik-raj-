        "### Characteristics of Lambda Functions:\n",
        "- **Anonymous**: Lambda functions do not have a name unless assigned to a variable.\n",
        "- **Single Expression**: They are limited to a single line of code, making them concise.\n",
        "- **Flexible**: Often used in situations where a simple function is needed temporarily.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Typical Uses:\n",
        "Lambda functions are commonly used in the following scenarios:\n",
        "- As arguments to higher-order functions (functions that take other functions as arguments).\n",
        "- In places where you need a small function for a short duration, such as sorting or filtering.\n",
