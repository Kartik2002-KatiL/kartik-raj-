        "# 1. What are the five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "###Ans.The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Encapsulation**: This is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, called a class. Encapsulation restricts direct access to some of an object’s components, which helps prevent unintended interference and misuse.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Abstraction**: Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors, while hiding the unnecessary details. It allows programmers to focus on interactions at a higher level without needing to understand all the underlying complexities.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Inheritance**: Inheritance allows a new class (subclass) to inherit properties and methods from an existing class (superclass). This promotes code reuse and establishes a natural hierarchy between classes, enabling polymorphism and enhancing organization.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It allows for methods to be used interchangeably, where a single interface can represent different underlying forms (data types). This is often achieved through method overriding and overloading.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Composition**: Composition is a design principle where a class is composed of one or more objects from other classes, rather than inheriting from them. This allows for greater flexibility and the ability to build complex types by combining simpler ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "These concepts together provide a framework for building modular, reusable, and organized code in software development."

        "   - It records the start time before calling the original function and the end time after the function has executed.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Calculating Execution Time**:\n",
        "   - The execution time is calculated by subtracting the start time from the end time.\n",
        "   - The decorator then prints the execution time formatted to six decimal places.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Returning the Result**:\n",
        "   - The `wrapper` function calls the original function and returns its result, allowing the decorated function to behave as expected.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Using the Decorator**:\n",
        "   - The `@timing_decorator` syntax is used to apply the decorator to the `example_function`.\n",

        "When you run the example, it will print the execution time for summing numbers from 1 to 1,000,000, along with the result of the computation. This decorator can be reused with any function where you want to measure execution time."

        "### Python's Resolution of the Diamond Problem\n",
        "\n",
        "Python uses the **C3 Linearization** algorithm (also known as C3 superclass linearization) to resolve the Diamond Problem. This algorithm provides a deterministic method for determining the order in which classes are searched for methods and attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Key Features of C3 Linearization:\n",
        "1. **Order of Declaration**: The method resolution order (MRO) respects the order in which base classes are declared.\n",
        "2. **No Repetition**: A class appears only once in the MRO, avoiding ambiguity.\n",
        "3. **Depth-First Search**: The MRO is built in a way that checks the leftmost base class first before moving to the right.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example Code\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's an implementation that demonstrates the Diamond Problem and how Python resolves it:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class A:\n",
        "    def show(self):\n",
        "        return \"Method from A\"\n",
        "\n",
        "class B(A):\n",
        "    def show(self):\n",
        "        return \"Method from B\"\n",
        "\n",
        "class C(A):\n",
        "    def show(self):\n",
        "        return \"Method from C\"\n",
        "\n",
        "class D(B, C):\n",
        "    pass\n",
        "\n",
        "# Create an instance of D\n",
        "d = D()\n",
        "\n",
        "# Call the show method\n",
        "print(d.show())  # Output: Method from B\n",
        "\n",
        "# Check the method resolution order\n",
        "print(D.mro())  # Output: [<class '__main__.D'>, <class '__main__.B'>, <class '__main__.C'>, <class '__main__.A'>, <class 'object'>]\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Explanation of the Code\n",
        "1. **Class Definitions**:\n",
        "   - `A` is the base class with a `show` method.\n",
        "   - `B` and `C` inherit from `A` and override the `show` method.\n",
        "   - `D` inherits from both `B` and `C`.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Method Resolution**:\n",
        "   - When `d.show()` is called, Python looks up the method according to the MRO. Since `B` is listed before `C` in the MRO, the method from `B` is called.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **MRO Check**:\n",
        "   - The `D.mro()` method returns the method resolution order, confirming the hierarchy Python follows to resolve method calls.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary\n",
        "The Diamond Problem illustrates a potential ambiguity in multiple inheritance scenarios. Python's C3 Linearization algorithm provides a systematic way to resolve this issue, ensuring that the method resolution order is predictable and avoids ambiguity in method calls."
